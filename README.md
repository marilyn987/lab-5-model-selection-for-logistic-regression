# lab-5-model-selection-for-logistic-regression
For this lab, I trained a logistic regression model on an Airbnb dataset to predict whether a host is a superhot. I used AUC curves to determine the best hyperparameters to result in the optimal model and used feature selection techniques to find the optimal number of features to use to result in the most accurate model.
